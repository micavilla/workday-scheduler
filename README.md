# Workday-Scheduler

## Description
This webpage allows users to plan their tasks in hour blocks within the day the page is accessed which is displayed in the header. Time blocks for each hour between 9AM to 5PM are displayed with editable text fields for the user to input their tasks for the respective hours. Once the save button is clicked for a filled-in text field, that text is saved in local storage and will remain displayed when the page is refreshed. Additionally, each hour block is color coded to represent whether that hour is past, present, or in the future.
